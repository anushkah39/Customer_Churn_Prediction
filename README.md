# Customer Churn Prediction
Machine learning-based customer churn prediction project using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. Includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature importance interpretation.



## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze customer behavior and predict churn rates using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

### Dataset
- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Description**: Contains data about customer demographics, services, and churn status.

### Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for analysis.
- `images/`: Visualizations and results.

### Key Steps
1. Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
2. Feature engineering and selection
3. Training machine learning models
4. Model evaluation and comparison

### Results
